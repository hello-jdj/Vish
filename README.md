## Notes

Vish is made for educational purposes and to simplify the process of creating Bash scripts. It is not intended to replace traditional text-based scripting but rather to provide an alternative way to visualize and construct scripts.  
It can help beginners understand the structure and flow of Bash scripts, making it easier to learn scripting concepts.

### Translating
An other way to contribute Vish is to help translating it in other languages. If you want to contribute to the translation of Vish, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b translation-branch`)
3. Create a new translation file in `assets/model/{language}.json` to add translations for the new language you want to add. **You can use the existing translations as a reference.**
4. Add the translations for the new language in the newly created file (Use a basic translator if you don't know the language, but please try to be as accurate as possible) and make sure to include translations for the language name (e.g. "lang_en", "lang_fr", etc.) so that it can be displayed in the settings.
5. Add the new language to the language combo box in `ui/settings.py` (You should update `_build_language_section` to add the new language to the combo box and also update `refresh_ui_texts` function to update the language name in the combo box when the language is changed with `update_combo_item` function)
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add translation for [Language]'`)
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin translation-branch`)
8. Create a new Pull Request
